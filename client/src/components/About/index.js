                I've always had interest in computers. In junior high, my dad bought us a family computer. I would spend hours trying to beat Mah Jongg. My uncle had a job working with computers at the time. He would come over and put all these commands in to DOS that looked like such a foriegn language. I knew when I got to the University of Minnesota, I wanted to get a degree using these fantastical machines. Of course, by then they weren't as new on the market. Even all these years later, there is so much innovation and growth it can be mind boggling.

                Here we are at present, with my pages I've made. I know I have a lot to learn, but learning is what keeps a person alive. In my original degree I learned object oriented programming, primarily with C and C++. My recent bootcamp was focused more on web coding, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and much more. For a more detailed look, feel free to check out my resume below. Or, shoot me an email. Let's have a talk about what I can do for you.
